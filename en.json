      "body": "A new Brahma Ratha will be offered to the Shri Gopalakrishna Temple located on Agrahara Street in Navoor village, which has a history of around 700 years. The dedication ceremony will take place on March 16, according to Rakesh Malli, president of the temple renovation committee. Speaking at a press conference held at the Press Club in B.C. Road, he mentioned that the annual Rathotsava used to be celebrated grandly on the temple street. However, since 1998, the event was discontinued due to the deteriorated condition of the old chariot, and a Pallakki Utsava (palanquin festival) was held instead. Now, a new chariot has been constructed at a cost of around â‚¹42 lakhs. On March 16, dignitaries will welcome the chariot in a procession near the Kaikamba Polali entrance. A full ceremonial welcome with traditional bhajans, drums, instruments, and announcements will take place from Sarapady Cross near Mani Hall to the temple."
